# ML Glossary

*Machine Learning Glossary* is a community-driven attempt at explaining the loads of buzzwords (Jargons) making the current Machine-learning/Deep-learning ecosystem in a few simple words. The idea is not to replace individual documentations, but to act as some kind of glossary that can be easily referenced.
