A variable of a model that the machine learning system trains on its own. For example, **[weights](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#weight)** are parameters whose values the machine learning system gradually learns through successive training iterations. Contrast with **[hyperparameter](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#hyperparameter)**.
